        <p>Building a web-enabled thermometer from a raspi is a fun and relatively easy project.</p>

<h3 id='picking_out_the_sensor_and_building_a_simple_harness'>Picking out the sensor and building a simple harness</h3>

<p>Like so many other rpi thermometer builds, I chose the DS18B20 single wire digital temperature sensor, as it&#8217;s quite accurate for its really cheap price.</p>

<p><img alt='DS18B20' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/ds18b20.jpg' /></p>

<p>For the wiring I used parts from an old broken computer, a floppy-disk cable to connect to the Pi, and some cables from the PSU with the molex-connectors intact. I&#8217;m planning to upgrade this into some rj-45 jacks instead, so I can easily make some longer cables with cat-6.</p>

<p><img alt='A wiring harness' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/cable_final.jpg' /></p>

<p>For now the sensors sit on top of an old CDA-cable, that i cut in half and soldered some connectors on the other end to fit the molex-connectors on the harness.</p>

<p><img alt='Modified CDA' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/ds18b20_fitted.jpg' /></p>

<p>The sensors need to be pulled down with a 4.7K ohm resistor, which i just stuck in one of the molexes in the harness.</p>

<p><img alt='4K7 fitted' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/4k7_fitted.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here is the basic schematic of the connections</p>

<p>And here is the finished product</p>

<p><img alt='finished' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/final.jpg' /></p>

<p>As you can see, you can use multiple sensors on the same wires, no need to use multiple pins on the pi.</p>

<h3 id='building_an_application'>Building an application</h3>

<p>I wanted to make the app at least somewhat modular and extensible, so that it could use different ways of storing the data and use an arbitrary number of sensors.</p>

<p>To achieve this goal with the least amount of effort, I just wrote a <a href='https://github.com/gildean/PiTherm/blob/master/config.json.default'>simple JSON-file to be used as the config</a>. In the file you can: set up your sensors, set up your database, set a refresh-rate and a css-theme.</p>

<h3 id='where_to_put_the_data'>Where to put the data?</h3>

<p>For the db in the initial build I chose the most used store for timeseries data; RRD. Fortunately there are a couple of different modules for node to use RRD, from which I picked the <a href='https://github.com/Orion98MC/node_rrd'>node rrd</a>. With a little tinkering, I wrote a <a href='https://github.com/gildean/PiTherm/blob/master/dbdrivers/rrd.js'>&#8220;driver&#8221;</a> to be used that creates a new RRD-file if none exists, and does searches properly as RRD requires the timespan to be divisble with the interval of the RRA. This module also requires for the <a href='http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/'>RRDtool</a> to be installed, but that just required a quick <code>sudo apt-get install rrdtool</code>.</p>

<h3 id='serving_the_data'>Serving the data</h3>

<p>As the rpi normally runs with an SD-card, I didn&#8217;t want to put too much stress on the disk and therefore wrote the <a href='https://github.com/gildean/PiTherm/blob/master/httpserver.js'>HTTP-server</a> to run completely in-memory. And because the device might be set up somewhere with poor internet-connection, I made the HTTP-server also save a Gzipped and a deflated version of each file, and added a simple etagging-function to run as well. The HTML and CSS are also concatted at startup, as are the two js-files.</p>

<p>For the application to be nice and real-timey, I included a <a href='https://github.com/gildean/PiTherm/blob/master/websocketserver.js'>WebSocket-server</a> to the mix. All the requests from the frontend after the initial page-load are made through the WebSocket-connection, which also helps to keep the network-traffic to a minimum. The server sends new updates every 30 seconds so the page can be used as an actual thermometer. With the websocket-server being the actual way of serving the data, the web-page isn&#8217;t the only option when creating a client either.</p>

<h3 id='something_to_look_at'>Something to look at</h3>

<p><img alt='Frontend' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/pitemp.png' /></p>

<p>The frontend itself is a fairly simple mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the ability to change the color-theme with a separate CSS-file. The elements for each sensor are built on pageload, so the frontend could also be used with as many sensors as wanted.</p>

<p>For the graphs I decided to use <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3.js</a> and make the graphs zoomable and pannable, so a graph with a large number of datapoints would be more usable. Here&#8217;s a sample of the graphs:</p>

<p><img alt='D3 in action' src='/img/posts/2013-06-01/pitemp-graph.png' /></p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the end the application was fairly simple to create and should be extensible at least to a certain degree. In the future I&#8217;ll also add an alert system that can be configured to send emails if the temperature drops or rises over a set mark.</p>
